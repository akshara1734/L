## What is Distilling Classes and Why Should You Care?

Distilling classes refers to the process of taking a complex, often monolithic, class and breaking it down into smaller, more manageable, and focused units. This approach offers several key benefits:

*   **Improved Readability:** Smaller classes are easier to understand and reason about.
*   **Enhanced Maintainability:** Changes become localized, reducing the risk of introducing bugs elsewhere in the codebase.
*   **Increased Reusability:** Smaller, focused classes are more likely to be reusable in other parts of your application.
*   **Better Testability:** Focused classes are easier to test in isolation.

This free course covers practical techniques for identifying and extracting responsibilities from large classes, including:

✔ **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Understanding and applying this core principle is crucial for effective class distillation.
✔ **Refactoring Patterns:** Learn proven refactoring patterns, such as Extract Class and Move Method, to safely distill your classes.
✔ **Dependency Injection:** Using dependency injection to decouple your distilled classes, improving testability and flexibility.
